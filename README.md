# ChatGPT-TextProcessing

The ChatGPT-TextProcessing repository provides utilities for processing text input to meet the character limit requirements of ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot. The character limit for each message in ChatGPT is approximately 2048 characters. However, longer texts can be processed by splitting them into multiple messages. It is important to appropriately mark the messages to ensure that ChatGPT treats them as a cohesive text on which we can perform the available chat analyses.

## Features

- Text splitting: Split long texts into multiple messages to fit the character limit of ChatGPT.
- Message tagging: Add appropriate message tags to ensure the continuity and coherence of split texts.
- Integration examples: Sample code and examples demonstrating how to use the text processing utilities in conjunction with ChatGPT.
